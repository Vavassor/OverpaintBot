#OverpaintBot

This is an art bot that posts to the [social network server Mastodon](https://mastodon.social). My instance of it runs on the [@OverpaintBot account](https://mastodon.social/users/OverpaintBot).

It continually draws over its previous image and posts the result. The idea is loosely based on [a short abstract art series I did in 2013-2014](http://vavassor.tumblr.com/tagged/vavremix).
